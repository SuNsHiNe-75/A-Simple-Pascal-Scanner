#### Introduction
This is the first assignment of the "Design and Implementation of Compiler" course at NSYSU, aiming to implement a **simple pascal scanner**.

In the first assignment, you must use Lex to write a Pascal scanner.
- Your scanner should be able to handle all reserved words, identifiers, symbols, integers, real numbers, comments, and quoted strings.
- If an invalid token is encountered, your scanner should generate an error message (error detection).
- Your scanner should strive to process all inputs as much as possible. If an error occurs, generate an error message and then continue processing other inputs (error recovery).  

The output of the scanner will list each token along with its type (integer, real, ID, reserved word, string, symbol), the line number where the token is located, and the position of the first character.
